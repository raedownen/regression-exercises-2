# regression-exercises
In this module, we will analyze, visualize and model various labeled datasets that are being stored in SQL and have continuous target variables. This means we will do supervised machine learning (because the data is labeled) using regression (because the target variable we are analyzing is continuous) on structured data (because the data can be naturally stored in rows and columns).
